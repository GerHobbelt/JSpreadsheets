# The Rules

Everybody is welcome to contribute to RailsVault, just fork the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/heyspacetime/rails-vault) and send a pull request.
Each Ruby on Rails starter is a markdown file in the `source/projects` directory.

We'll only accept pull requests adding new Ruby on Rails starter if they follow the following rules:

*   **Ruby on Rails Starter:** The ideal starter is either a for Production starter or a hack-it-really-fast perfect for an MVP starter.
*   **Open Source:** The project must be released under an open source license.
*   **Accessible on GitHub:** The project must have a public repository on GitHub that we can link to and pull in stats from.
*   **Stick to the format:** Fill out all the same fields as the other static site generators in `source/projects`.

Many Ruby on Rails starters support different template engines. Don't list them all in the template field, just the one(s) used by default. Feel free to go into more details in the body text.
